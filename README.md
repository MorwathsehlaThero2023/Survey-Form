# Survey-Form

The Survey Form project involved utilizing HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly and responsive survey or questionnaire. HTML was used to create form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus. CSS was applied to style the form elements, making them visually cohesive and easy to navigate. The form was designed to adapt to different screen sizes using responsive design principles.

Furthermore, JavaScript could be incorporated to validate user input, providing real-time feedback and ensuring that the submitted data meets the required criteria.

The Survey Form project showcased my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing forms, enhancing the user experience while collecting valuable information.
